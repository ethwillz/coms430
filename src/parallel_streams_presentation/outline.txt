 Defining important terms

 Explain sections in beginning of paragraph

1. Ease of adding parallelization to a stream
    * Streams can be easily made into parallel operations with .parallel or .parallelStream
    * Data structures can be adapted by adding a Spliterator
        - Look through ArrayList's as super good example (with trysplit call showing what it does)
        - Go through a couple simple implementations
3. Collectors
    * How they work
    - Use cases
4. Dangers of parallel streams
    * Submitting long-running tasks to the thread pool causes blockage of all parallel stream tasks
