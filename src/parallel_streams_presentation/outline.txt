Java 8 Parallel Streams Presentation:

1. Ease of adding parallelization to a stream
    * Streams can be easily made into parallel operations with .parallel or .parallelStream
    * Data structures can be adapted by adding a Spliterator
        - Look through ArrayList's as super good example
        - Go through a couple simple implementations
3. Collectors
    * How they work
    - Use cases
4. Dangers of parallel streams
    * Submitting long-running tasks to the thread pool causes blockage of all parallel stream tasks
    - Tristan's story of trying to manage transactions with parallel streams
        - Was trying to process transactions through our accounting system faster which involved modifications to other
          parts of the system based on the data processed
        - Spent 2 days constantly messing up data (I think he has a test table in dev, hopefully)
        - Ended up figuring out that the List he was storing everything in wasn't thread safe so he has all kinds of
          thread collisions trying to edit data concurrently
